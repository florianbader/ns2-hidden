Natural Selection 2: Hidden Mod
==========

Hidden is a new gameplay modification for Natural Selection 2 based on The Hidden: Source.

**What's this all about?**
In Hidden Mod you have the Marine team and the Hidden. The Hidden is a Fade which escaped the research facility of TSA where they made experiments with it. Unfortunately those experiments gave the Hidden permanent upgrades which make him the perfect killer: fast (Celerity), stronger (Carapace and Adrenalin), silent, invisible (Cloak) and enhanced abilities (Shadowstep, Blink, Vortex).
The Marines need to kill the Hidden within a given time, otherwise they loose and the Hidden will escape.

**How can I play it?**
It's not done yet.
If it is done, just type in 'hidden' as game in your Natural Selection 2 server browser and if there are any servers which run the Hidden mod you should see them.
